# equipment_rental
Equipment rental app is based on 3 applications. Two of these are frontend meanwhile one is backend. Apps are made in Python_Flask (backend), Visual_Studio_C# (frontend), JS (frontend - read only). App helps sort different equipment for a company that borrows equipment. They can add different categories to equipment and get reports when equipment was rented and when will it be returned. At the return company can write a report and change a state that equipment is in. All the data can be exported to excel.
